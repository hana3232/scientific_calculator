# Scientific Calculator

This is a simple **Scientific Calculator** built using Python and Tkinter. It supports basic arithmetic operations along with scientific functions such as `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `exp`, and `sqrt`.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Scientific functions:
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
  - Logarithmic function: `log`
  - Exponential function: `exp`
  - Square root function: `sqrt`
- Support for parentheses for complex calculations
- User-friendly GUI

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended). The script uses the following built-in Python modules:

- `tkinter` for GUI
- `math` for scientific calculations

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python scientific_calculator.py
   ```
4. The calculator window will open, allowing you to perform calculations.

## How to Use

- Click on the numeric and function buttons to input values.
- Use `C` to clear the input field.
- Click `=` to evaluate the expression.
- The scientific functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, etc.) can be used with numerical values.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more advanced mathematical functions.
- Implement a history feature to track previous calculations.
- Introduce a dark mode theme.
